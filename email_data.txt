A gift guide just for you

Hello [Prospect name],
I know it's the busy holiday season, but I wanted to say "hello" and remind you why we're such a good match. Think of each point as a small gift to yourself this year:

[Insert prospect problem + how you can solve it] (i.e., Data entry is eating away at your time, but Company X can reduce entry time by X%.)
[Insert product, service or feature]: [Insert reason/way it benefits your prospect] (i.e., Multi-user upload function: Kiss the days of waiting for your 10 teammates to finish uploading before you have a chance. This feature offers a solution to one of your biggest pain points.)
[Insert budgetary fit + discount info for buying before end of year] (i.e., Our price + your budget = the perfect fit)

If you're ready to get that demo scheduled, grab some time on my calendar here: [Link to meetings tool]
Happy Holidays,

[Product/feature name]: [What it does and how it benefits the client]

targeted advertisements so you only pay for the people you want to reach

Some of our top clients include Burger King, P&G and Chili’s.
I want America Station to join this list.

You'll find section X particularly valuable.

I know a recommendation from you will significantly elevate my profile. I greatly appreciate your time, and hope to hear from you soon.
Thank you,

Let’s sell your house (now!)

Hello [Prospect],
I noticed your listing for [address] recently expired. You’re probably feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and impatient -- but I believe I can help.
Many times, when homes don’t sell, real estate agents blame the price. That’s not quite fair. These homes often suffer from poor marketing. That’s why I consider myself both a marketer and a Realtor.
I’ve sold [number] houses in [neighborhood] in an average of [number] days for [percent] over asking price -- and I do it with smart marketing and [number] years serving the [city] area.

I know your property inside and out. I've been carefully collecting buyer and agent feedback, monitoring other homes in the neighborhood, and have an intimate familiarity with what makes your home unique.
I'm prepared to offer you a new limited-service option, which comes with a discounted commission, which means you save money.
I have an action plan for how I think we can move forward and sell your home in 30 days or less. I'd love to discuss it with you in person or over the phone at your earliest convenience. Book time on my calendar here: [Insert calendar link]

What home means to me

Hello [Prospect name],
Choosing a Realtor can be tough -- and finding the right fit is one of the most important decisions you can make. Realtors (including myself) throw around a lot of stats about buying and selling homes, but it comes down to people looking for a place to be healthy, happy, and build a life.
To help illustrate how very human and personal this process is, I wanted to share a story from a recent client, [client name].

Hi First Name,

I think some of the ideas they came up with for using some of the new features were unique. It definitely had me thinking about different ways I could set up my account.I’m coming up on Graduation or End of Current Role in a few months, and would love the opportunity to be on a team that creates such great work.

Hi First Name,

Thank you for the opportunity to come and chat a second time. I didn’t think I could be any more enthusiastic about working with your team after the first interview - but I was wrong.

In fact, we discussed Project Name and I had a quick idea about making it successful. Attached is a quick explanation of what I was thinking. Whether this is on-point or completely off-base, I hope to get the chance to discuss it.Please let me know if there’s anything else you need moving forward, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?



All "The Office" jokes aside, spring is a time when I touch base with old contacts to see if we're a better fit now — like recycling old relationships to form the new.
If you'd like to set up a quick phone call, book time on my calendar here: [Insert calendar link]
Thanks,

Do you feel like Bill Murray?

Hey [prospect name],
February 2 has come and gone, but I'm starting to worry my emails to you are making you feel like Phil Connors in Groundhog Day.

No one wants to relive the same experience over and over. If [solving X challenge, exploring Y opportunity] is no longer a priority, please let me know and I'll stop reaching out.
Thanks,[Your name]

Spring cleaning

Hi [prospect name],
I'm spring cleaning my files and saw you hadn't responded to my calls or emails in a while. Are you still considering [doing X, solving Y]? If not, I won't reach out again.
Thanks,[Your name]


Sales_Spring themed emails_templates:
Need a spring break from me?

Hi [Prospect name],
I haven't heard back from you in a while. I hate to part ways before you've heard how I can help you [increase X, decrease Y], but I understand that now might not be the right time.
If you'd like to keep our conversation going, please respond to this email. If not, no problem. I'll simply assume we're on a break :)
Thanks,

Sales_Spring themed emails_templates:
Is the sun setting on us?

The days are getting longer and the sun is setting later, so I thought that might give us a little more time to discover whether [Your company] can help [Buyer's company].
I'd love to tell you how I've helped similar companies increase their D&I recruiting by up to 55%. If this sounds like something you're interested in, you can book time on my calendar here: [Link to calendar]
Thanks,

Sales_Spring themed emails_templates:
I’m allergic to sales emails too

Hi [prospect name],
Fresh blooms aren’t the only things giving me allergies this year — salesy emails have been out of control lately. It looks like our previous conversation got lost in the shuffle and I wanted to reach out one more time.
Do you still need support with [doing X, solving Y]? If so, I’m happy to help. You can book time on my calendar here: [Link to calendar]. If I don’t hear from you by next week, I’ll stay out of your inbox.
Thanks,
[Your name]

What [prospect's competitor] is missing

Hi [prospect name],
I recently got off the phone with someone in [relevant department] at [company in prospect’s space]. [Company] is doing some really interesting things around [business area prospect is interested in].
Would you like to hear how I think [prospect’s company] could apply some of those takeaways?
Best,[Your name]


Mentioning the buyer’s competitor will immediately spark their fear of falling behind. They’ll be eager to learn how they can update their strategy -- meaning you’ll get a response asking when you’re available. (Better yet, include a link to your calendar so they can schedule a meeting right then and there.)
This message is also compelling because it establishes your knowledge of the space. You show you're not only familiar with the competition, but have valuable information about their game plan as well.
Of course, never invent a conversation that didn’t happen. It’s not worth the risk of being caught.

[Prospect's company] compared to average?

Hey [prospect name],
I’m impressed by your [campaign for X, recent company announcement about Y, work in Z area]. I’d expect your results to be above the [industry, vertical, market] average.
Would you be interested in discovering exactly where you stand compared to your peers?
Best,[Your name]


With your inside view into companies with similar products, missions, locations, audiences, and so on, you’re ideally positioned to extend this offer -- and few are more enticing.
If your prospect is hitting it out of the park, she’ll want to see just how hardily she’s beating the other companies in her space. If she’s doing good but not great, the buyer will want to learn her current margin so she can increase it. And if she’s failing, she’ll be curious to know if everyone else is struggling even more than she is.

Thoughts on [likely challenge]

Hi [prospect name],
Lately, I’ve spent some time thinking about [challenge prospect is likely facing]. It’s a big issue for companies like yours -- after all, [reason why this pain point is significant].
I don’t have a full-fledged solution yet. However, I do have a couple ideas that could make a difference. Do you want to hear them?
Best,[Your name]


Leading with a relevant pain point tells your prospect that you’re knowledgeable -- and just as importantly, empathetic and helpful.
By admitting you don’t have the perfect answer, you’ll seem genuine rather than salesy. The buyer will feel compelled to reply and learn what you’ve come up with.

Taking [X step] at [prospect's company]

Hey [prospect name],
I saw you haven’t [updated X strategy, changed over to Y system, added Z policy]. While I don’t want to ring any unnecessary alarm bells, I think you’re risking your company’s [long-term growth in A, health in specific area B, plans for C].
Here’s the first thing I’d do: [Actionable suggestion or high-level tip]. If you’d like to hear the next steps, let me know.
Best,[Your name]


Bring your prospect’s inaction front and center. Once you’ve reminded them they still haven’t made any progress, they typically want to correct that as soon as possible.
To make sure the buyer follows up with you -- rather than coming up with their own plan  -- give them a solid tip. They’ll quickly see you as a source of guidance.
Urgent Reminder Emails

Biggest takeaway from our call today

Hi [prospect name],I’ve included a recap of what we discussed today. One of the most significant insights from our conversation: You’re currently [losing X per month, missing out on Y per week, at a huge risk for X]. The sooner [prospect’s company] [solves this challenge, takes this opportunity], the better.
Main items covered:

[Item #1]
[Item #2]
[Item #3]

I'm looking forward to speaking again on [date and time]. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.
Best,[Your name]


This email reinforces the urgency you (hopefully) instilled during the call. Its straightforward, neutral tone conveys confidence and tells your prospect you’re not wasting any time or words.
They’ll start taking the matter seriously, if they haven’t already.

Timeline for [doing X] by [date]

Hi [prospect name],
Glad we got the chance to discuss [topic] today. [Important event] you mentioned is just X [days, weeks, months] away -- if you want to have a strategy for [achieving Y] by then, you’ll need to follow this timeline:

[Action step #1] by [date]
[Action step #2] by [date]
[Action step #3] by [date]

Are you available on [date and time] to talk about [action step #1]?
Thanks,[Your name]


Remind your prospect time is of the essence. To hit their goals, they can’t let this deal slip to the bottom of their to-do list.
Providing a sample timeline is effective for two reasons. First, it’s a major value-add: Rather than figuring out what they need to do and when, the buyer can follow your plan. Second, it structures the sales conversation. Your prospect will know what to expect from each stage, which makes them feel more secure.
Urgent Follow-Up Emails 

Few more suggestions for [solving X]

Hey [prospect name],
Now that I’ve had some time to think about our last conversation on [date], I’ve come up with a few more suggestions for [solving X pain point, meeting Y objective, exploring Z opportunity]. You’ll be excited to hear these.
Here’s a link to my calendar so you can book a time that works: [Link].
Cheers,[Your name]


This template -- which isn’t for the faint of heart -- lets you take back control of the sales conversation.
First, the offer gives your prospect a great reason to reply. Who doesn’t want free, no-strings-attached ideas for hitting their goals or improving their business?
Telling the buyer they’ll be “excited to hear” these ideas also shows a lot of confidence -- as does linking to your calendar rather than asking if they’re available on a certain date and time. Typically, this self-assurance makes you seem more credible.

How [customer] achieved [X results]

Hi [prospect name],
[Prospect’s job title] at [rep’s company] is always busy doing [X, Y, and Z] -- so I assume you’ve got a full plate as well.
But spending some time upfront to put in place a solution for [pain point] will pay off exponentially. [Customer], for example, [saved X hours per week, trimmed Y from their budget, made Z more per month] after using [product].
Are you free on [date and time] to pick up where we left off?
Thanks,[Your name]


Guilt-tripping the buyer for their unresponsiveness doesn’t work -- they’ll either feel annoyed or ashamed, neither of which prompt them to reply.
So, use a different approach. Show that you’re not taking it personally they haven’t gotten back to you: Based on your relationship with their counterpart at your company, you know they’re slammed.
Then, remind your prospect they really can’t afford to wait. This one-two punch of empathy and urgency convinces buyers to answer every time.

[Prospect's name], you're a special case

Hi [prospect name],
Normally, I stop following up with people if they haven’t gotten back to me after [X weeks]. I figure they’re not interested, and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.
However, my conscience won’t let me give up so easily with you. Based on our conversations on [date and time] and [date and time], I’m confident you could [solve X pain point, capitalize on Y opportunity] -- which will allow you to [get that promotion to X role, increase your team’s output by Y amount, outperform your competitors in Z area].
So before I walk away: Are you sure you’re not interested in [solving X, capitalizing on Y]?
Best,[Your name]


This straightforward, honest email will help you re-engage prospects who have gone dark. It suggests the buyer would be foolhardy to let this opportunity slip through their fingers.
In addition, your prospect doesn’t have to ponder their response. You’re not asking a tricky question or demanding a meeting -- you’re simply asking if they’ll reconsider their lack of interest. The buyer can type “yes” or “no” without pausing.
If it’s the latter, schedule another conversation. If it’s the former, remove the opportunity from your pipeline and focus your energy on better fit prospects.
With this email templates up your sleeve, kindling urgency becomes as simple as pressing "Send."

If it’s the latter, schedule another conversation. If it’s the former, remove the opportunity from your pipeline and focus your energy on better fit prospects.

Biggest takeaway from our call today

Hi [prospect name],I’ve included a recap of what we discussed today. One of the most significant insights from our conversation: You’re currently [losing X per month, missing out on Y per week, at a huge risk for X]. The sooner [prospect’s company] [solves this challenge, takes this opportunity], the better.
Main items covered:

[Item #1]
[Item #2]
[Item #3]

I'm looking forward to speaking again on [date and time]. Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.
Best,[Your name]


This email reinforces the urgency you (hopefully) instilled during the call. Its straightforward, neutral tone conveys confidence and tells your prospect you’re not wasting any time or words.
They’ll start taking the matter seriously, if they haven’t already.

Timeline for [doing X] by [date]

Hi [prospect name],
Glad we got the chance to discuss [topic] today. [Important event] you mentioned is just X [days, weeks, months] away -- if you want to have a strategy for [achieving Y] by then, you’ll need to follow this timeline:

[Action step #1] by [date]
[Action step #2] by [date]
[Action step #3] by [date]

Are you available on [date and time] to talk about [action step #1]?
Thanks,[Your name]


Remind your prospect time is of the essence. To hit their goals, they can’t let this deal slip to the bottom of their to-do list.
Providing a sample timeline is effective for two reasons. First, it’s a major value-add: Rather than figuring out what they need to do and when, the buyer can follow your plan. Second, it structures the sales conversation. Your prospect will know what to expect from each stage, which makes them feel more secure.

Few more suggestions for [solving X]

Hey [prospect name],
Now that I’ve had some time to think about our last conversation on [date], I’ve come up with a few more suggestions for [solving X pain point, meeting Y objective, exploring Z opportunity]. You’ll be excited to hear these.
Here’s a link to my calendar so you can book a time that works: [Link].
Cheers,[Your name]


This template -- which isn’t for the faint of heart -- lets you take back control of the sales conversation.
First, the offer gives your prospect a great reason to reply. Who doesn’t want free, no-strings-attached ideas for hitting their goals or improving their business?
Telling the buyer they’ll be “excited to hear” these ideas also shows a lot of confidence -- as does linking to your calendar rather than asking if they’re available on a certain date and time. Typically, this self-assurance makes you seem more credible.

How [customer] achieved [X results]

Hi [prospect name],
[Prospect’s job title] at [rep’s company] is always busy doing [X, Y, and Z] -- so I assume you’ve got a full plate as well.
But spending some time upfront to put in place a solution for [pain point] will pay off exponentially. [Customer], for example, [saved X hours per week, trimmed Y from their budget, made Z more per month] after using [product].
Are you free on [date and time] to pick up where we left off?
Thanks,[Your name]


Guilt-tripping the buyer for their unresponsiveness doesn’t work -- they’ll either feel annoyed or ashamed, neither of which prompt them to reply.
So, use a different approach. Show that you’re not taking it personally they haven’t gotten back to you: Based on your relationship with their counterpart at your company, you know they’re slammed.
Then, remind your prospect they really can’t afford to wait. This one-two punch of empathy and urgency convinces buyers to answer every time.

[Prospect's name], you're a special case

Hi [prospect name],
Normally, I stop following up with people if they haven’t gotten back to me after [X weeks]. I figure they’re not interested, and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.
However, my conscience won’t let me give up so easily with you. Based on our conversations on [date and time] and [date and time], I’m confident you could [solve X pain point, capitalize on Y opportunity] -- which will allow you to [get that promotion to X role, increase your team’s output by Y amount, outperform your competitors in Z area].
So before I walk away: Are you sure you’re not interested in [solving X, capitalizing on Y]?

Dear [Customer Name],
I'm so sorry that I gave you an invalid solution to your software malfunction. I take full responsibility for my actions and deeply regret the inconvenience that it must have caused you.

That's no excuse, and I apologize for my unguided actions. In the future, I will be sure to ask several questions of my customers to fully understand the situation before offering a solution.
I hope you can forgive me and that we can continue to work together if you have any more support needs.
Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
Best,
[Your name]

I can’t offer you truffles, but …

I can offer you a free consultation on [your lead gen strategy, D&I initiatives, customer referrals plays]. I’ve worked with several companies in your space, including [similar company #1] and [similar company #2], and I’d love to share some of the things that worked for them — as well as some ideas I had just for [name of prospect’s company].
If you’re interested, you can book some time on my calendar here: [Link to Meetings tool.]

Disappointed by your V-Day gift?

Hi [prospect name],
I’m sure what you were really hoping for this year on Valentine’s Day was [a one-year subscription to a product, an upgrade to our Pro version, 100 shipments of Product A, etc.] But if you just got chocolates or flowers, don’t fear — you can always treat yourself.
I’d love to show you how [product] can support your [Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, etc.] goals in 2021. Do you have 10 minutes this week to catch up?
Best,
[Your name]


Formal_Valentines day_templates:
It’s the best day of the year

[Prospect], you’re probably wondering why.
It’s not because I’m about to eat my body weight in chocolate-covered almonds (my mom always comes through.) It’s because I have a good feeling you’re going to schedule another call with me so we can pick up where we left off. Your [lead gen, recruiting, events marketing, employee wellness] strategy is important to me. :)
What do you say — make my day?
[Your name]


Formal_Valentines day_templates:
Don’t go breakin’ my heart

Hi [prospect],
I haven’t heard from you in a while. Usually, when someone vanishes like this, it’s because A) they’ve gotten caught up in other projects at work, B) this isn’t a priority right now, or C) they’re no longer interested.
If it’s A) or B), will you let me know?
Thanks,
[Your name]


Formal_Valentines day_templates:
Have you found the one? The perfect match?

Hey [prospect name],
Wanted to check in and see how you were liking [competitor product]. Is it the perfect fit for your process/set-up?
A) Yes, I love it
B) Honestly, things could be better
If the answer is B, let’s talk about how you can get more out of your [tool for doing XYZ]. Here’s my calendar: [Link to meetings tool]. Please grab some time whenever works for you.
Best,
[Your name]


Formal_Valentines day_templates:
Life is like a box of chocolates …

Everyone always eats the caramel chews first.
But that’s not why I’m reaching out today, [prospect]. As disappointing as it is to open that Russell Stover’s box and be confronted with a few sad cherry cordials, it’s even worse to deal with disappointing results around [relevant strategy or goal, such as “your blogging traffic goals”].
When we talked in [month] last year, you weren’t ready to make a decision. If that’s changed, let’s discuss how you can jumpstart your XYZ efforts in 2021.
Best,
[Your name]


Formal_Valentines day_templates:
[Company name] loves working with you

Hi [prospect name],
Just wanted to shoot you a quick note to say I really appreciate your business. Looking at [my coworker’s notes, my records, your usage data], you’ve managed to accomplish a lot since we started working together:

Accomplishment #1, e.g. “Hired 10 new people”
Accomplishment #2, e.g. “Doubled average number of applications”
Accomplishment #3, e.g. “Increased number of employee referrals by 20%”

Let me know if there’s anything more I — or my team — can do to support you.
Have a great day,
[Your name]


Formal_Valentines day_templates:
Share the love?

Hi [prospect],
It’s been [a week, a month, a few months] since you [started using Product X, joined the Company community], and I wanted to check in and see what you thought.
If you’re happy, I’d love to [ask you a few questions for a customer testimonial, feature you in a case study, get your thoughts on Review Site XYZ].
If you’re not happy, let me know why and maybe I can help.
In any case, hope to hear from you soon.
Best,

Michael,
It was fantastic meeting you last week at the Orange Conference. I enjoyed our conversation about innovative software and building great things.
As we were discussing the software I'm working to build, you mentioned knowing Alexa over at Example Ventures and how she's an expert in this space. If you're willing, an introduction to Alexa would be greatly beneficial and she might be interested in learning more.
I understand you have a busy schedule, so I attached a short blurb below to make the introduction as easy as possible. Would you be able to take a moment to introduce me?
Thanks,Matt

Hi Carrie,
It was great to connect on the phone today. I really enjoyed learning more about your team's goals for Q4. I've had a few ideas on how we can partner to make it your biggest quarter yet.
I'm looking forward to running a few of those ideas by you in our next meeting. 
How about this Friday at 10:00 A.M EST?

Hi [prospect name],
I bet the subject line made you think there'd be a Rebecca Black gif or video inside this email. But I wouldn't do that to you.
The real reason I'm reaching out is to ask about your strategy for X [in 2018, next quarter, in response to Y trigger event]. I have a few suggestions I'd be happy to talk through -- after the weekend, of course. Are you free on Monday next week?
Thanks,
[Your name]


Sales_Unconventional_templates:
Life is good

Hi [prospect name],
The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and you know exactly how to [solve X likely pain point, respond to Y trigger event, hit Z objective]. Right?
If you're still working on that last one -- which I know is a focus for many [description of company profile] right now -- I'd love to offer some of the strategies I've shared with [customer #1] and [customer #2]. My calendar is available here: [Meetings link]. I hope to speak with you soon!
Cheers,

This is why the GOT finale failed ...

Hi [Prospect name],
If you watched "Game of Thrones," you know about that ending. If you never cared about "Game of Thrones," chances are, you still know about that ending. My two cents? It was totally rushed and haphazard.
Let's not be "Game of Thrones."
I'd love for us to take as much time as we need to get to know our respective businesses and see if we're the right fit for each other. If you'd like to kick things off with a quick call, book some time on my calendar here: [Insert Meetings link]
