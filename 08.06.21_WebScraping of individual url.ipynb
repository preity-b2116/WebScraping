       " <h4><strong>1. Model after the copy only.</strong></h4>\n",
       " <p>These examples are focused on the email copy only. Some of them have mocked-up branding, footers, or <a href=\"https://localiq.com/blog/2021-social-media-marketing-trends/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">social media</a> elements, but not all; and they should <strong>not</strong> serve as models for your email design. Good, <a href=\"https://localiq.com/blog/marketing/what-is-email-marketing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">targeted, marketing emails</a> often have branded headers, footers containing your website, social media handles, and other contact information, and they should always have an unsubscribe option. You may also want to add graphic elements for a better appeal.

       " <p>There are a number of ways to optimize your emails for opens, clicks, and other metrics. This post focuses mainly on helping you to get your copy laid out, but you will notice some common themes among the templates I’ve written, which I’ve summed up below:</p>\n",
       " <ul>\n",
       " <li>Even you have a CTA button in your email, you may also want to hyperlink text within the email <strong>to the same destination </strong>(i.e. never have more than one call to action in the same email).</li>\n",
       " <li>If they’re aligned with your brand voice, emojis can make your email copy (and <a href=\"https://localiq.com/blog/email-subject-lines-for-sales/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">subject lines</a>) pop and add a pleasant and personable touch.</li>\n",
       " <li>Try out addressing the recipient by name in both the body of the email and even the subject line.</li>\n",
       " <li>Make your email a tight and compact package. The basic formula for most of the examples in this post is:<br/>\n",
       " 1) Address pain points or desires. 2) Present your offer. 3) Provide key benefits. 4) Reiterate the offer as a solution. 4) CTA button</li>\n",
       " <li>The “from” for your emails may vary. Sending emails from your VP of Marketing, for example, can give your business an authoritative yet approachable feel. Emails from your company name are pretty neutral and may invite more opens if you have a high level of <a href=\"https://localiq.com/blog/how-to-run-customer-loyalty-programs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brand loyalty</a>. Other emails might be best coming from a team member or the host of the event you’re promoting, to build familiarity. Try out different senders depending on the purpose of your emails.</li>\n",
       " <li>When sending emails from a person, include a headshot in the signature to make the email more personal.</li>\n",
       " <li>Your email signature should always include contact information, but it can vary. In some cases, you may want to include all points of contact: website, phone, address, social media handles, LinkedIn profile link, fax number, social sec… — just kidding. In other cases, you might just want to provide the preferred contact method for that particular offering. In this case, your footer will come in handy.</li>\n",
       " <li>Note the heavy usage of bullet points. This format is ideal for helping your readers quickly get their most important question answered: what’s in it for me?</li>\n",

      "I am very excited for you to be able to perform the miracle that is copy + paste for these email templates, thereby making your life easier and your brain a little less mad at you. But let’s just cover a few things before we begin:\n",
      "1. Model after the copy only.\n",
      "These examples are focused on the email copy only. Some of them have mocked-up branding, footers, or social media elements, but not all; and they should not serve as models for your email design. Good, targeted, marketing emails often have branded headers, footers containing your website, social media handles, and other contact information, and they should always have an unsubscribe option. You may also want to add graphic elements for a better appeal. For help with email beyond just the copy, check out these best practices and tips on email marketing with regard to formatting, spam compliance measures, headers, footers, and more.\n",
      "Here’s an example of a complete marketing email from WordStream. Of course, it’s not the only way to design an email, but just to give you an idea of the header, footer, unsubscribe, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Everything is made up.\n",
      "For the record, my name is not Jane and I am neither a Director of Client Communications nor a Google Ads Expert for any business, anywhere. I just wanted to include a headshot signature to show you how nice it looks in an email. The companies and information in these examples are also 100% made up. Some towns don’t exist, zip codes are anything but accurate, and website names are a total toss-up.\n",
      "3. Think adapt, not adopt.\n",
      "The main purpose of these small business email examples and templates is to spare you the stress [read: mental agony] of coming up with email copy from scratch (we’ve got an email subject line guide here). Use them as a starting point but then be sure to adapt them to your brand personality in terms of formatting, style, and tone.\n",
      "4. Note the key takeaways at the end.\n",
      "At the end of this post, I provide some key takeaways from these email examples and templates to keep in mind when creating your own. They’re not an exhaustive list of email marketing best practices, but they should give you some guidelines to get you goin’!\n",

      "There are a number of ways to optimize your emails for opens, clicks, and other metrics. This post focuses mainly on helping you to get your copy laid out, but you will notice some common themes among the templates I’ve written, which I’ve summed up below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Even you have a CTA button in your email, you may also want to hyperlink text within the email to the same destination (i.e. never have more than one call to action in the same email).\n",
      "If they’re aligned with your brand voice, emojis can make your email copy (and subject lines) pop and add a pleasant and personable touch.\n",
      "Try out addressing the recipient by name in both the body of the email and even the subject line.\n",
      "Make your email a tight and compact package. The basic formula for most of the examples in this post is:\n",
      "1) Address pain points or desires. 2) Present your offer. 3) Provide key benefits. 4) Reiterate the offer as a solution. 4) CTA button\n",
      "The “from” for your emails may vary. Sending emails from your VP of Marketing, for example, can give your business an authoritative yet approachable feel. Emails from your company name are pretty neutral and may invite more opens if you have a high level of brand loyalty. Other emails might be best coming from a team member or the host of the event you’re promoting, to build familiarity. Try out different senders depending on the purpose of your emails.\n",
      "When sending emails from a person, include a headshot in the signature to make the email more personal.\n",
      "Your email signature should always include contact information, but it can vary. In some cases, you may want to include all points of contact: website, phone, address, social media handles, LinkedIn profile link, fax number, social sec… — just kidding. In other cases, you might just want to provide the preferred contact method for that particular offering. In this case, your footer will come in handy.\n",
      "Note the heavy usage of bullet points. This format is ideal for helping your readers quickly get their most important question answered: what’s in it for me?\n",

      "Hopefully, these email examples and templates have accomplished my goal: to help you communicate with your audience without expending your precious time and mental energy. Good luck!\n",

But, if your new employer doesn’t do that? It’s not a bad idea to reach out to your fellow newbie—after all, he or she is truly the only one who can sympathize with your new job jitters!  Hey [Name], My name is [Your Name] and I’m getting started as a [job title] here. I hear it’s both of our first day, so I thought I’d reach out and make an introduction. Us newbies need to stick together, right?  Let me know if you ever need someone to help you wander around aimlessly until you find the break room (yes, this is me admitting that I already got lost…twice!).  Wishing you all the best as you get up to speed—we’re in the same boat! [Your Name]        Email Template #7 For the Whole Office    If you work for the type of company that makes an office-wide announcement via email on your first day, this is your opportunity to respond to that message and make an awesome first impression. Bonus points if you came prepared with some sweet treats to keep by your desk.  Hey everybody, Thanks so much for the warm welcome! I’m so looking forward to working with all of you and getting to know everyone a little bit better. With that in mind, don’t hesitate to swing by my desk, grab a [candy or treat], and say “hey!” See you soon, [Your Name]  I know that starting a new job can be nerve-wracking—and, it becomes even more anxiety-inducing when you’re constantly reminded how important it is that you start with a bang.  Fortunately, that doesn’t need to be as complicated as it sounds. Send a few of these emails to the people you’ll be working with, and you’re sure to kick things off on the right foot. \n",
